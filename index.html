	  	<p>Hello my name is Issam Himmi, and this is the site I made for my first assignment in Web Development.
	  	   I was born in Morocco on February 15th, 1996, and moved to the United States when I was seven years old.
	  	   I am currently a senior at the University of St. Thomas. My hobbies include tinkering with computers, playing video games, and watching basketball games. Included below is an image of me and
	  	   a video showing how this site works.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>In this assignment I used HTML (Hypertext Markup Language, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Javascript to build this site. HTML is used as the backbone of this site,
	  	   as it contains the text and images used in this site. CSS is used to make the HTML elements look better, as it offers the tools to change things such as size, font, and
	  	   where things are placed on the site. Javascript is used to add interactivity to HTML elements, allowing you to interact with some elements on this site such as the image gallery.
	  	</p>
